   - `POST /api/users/login - Login user`

 - CAR MANANGEMENT
   - `GET /api/cars - Get all cars`
   - `GET /api/cars/:id - Get specific car`
   - `POST /api/cars - Create a car (Admin only)`
   - `PUT /api/cars/:id - Update a car (Admin only)`
   - `DELETE /api/cars/:id - Delete a car (Admin only)`
